# Results

## Cursor

Started out strong, had a nice project layout and just went to town writing code. However, it did not work. After 3-4 attempts the search was still returning zero results.

## WindSurf

The clear winner. 

It wrote a much simpler project structure, however, it just worked. It could search its home directory immediately. When I attempted to search a second directory it had to make a quick fix. However, it created a test directory by default and populated it with test data. This was a bug plus here. 

## Conclusion

I will be testing out WindSurf for the next month to see how it works for me
